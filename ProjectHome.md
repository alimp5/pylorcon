## PYLORCON2 PROJECT MOVED TO: http://github.com/tom5760/pylorcon2 ##


pylorcon is a Python wrapper for the C LORCON (Loss Of Radio CONnectivity) library.  LORCON is a generic library for injecting 802.11 frames, capable of injection via multiple driver frameworks, without forcing modification of the application code.

pylorcon wraps all the functionality of LORCON.  If you find any problems with it, or have any suggestions/comments/etc please send them to me at tom5760 AT gmail DOT com.

A bit was taken from the starting Python wrapper found at http://802.11ninja.net/lorcon/ticket/1

See: http://802.11ninja.net/lorcon/ for more information about LORCON.
